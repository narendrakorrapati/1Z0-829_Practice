     1. Records are implicitly final

     3. Provides accessor methods with property name, in this case numberEggs() and name()
     4. Overrides Object's equals, hashCode and toString methods
     5. The compiler will not insert a constructor if you define one with the same list of parameters in the same order.
     6. All properties must be set in if constructor is provided by developer, failing to do so will fail to compile as all the fields are final
     7. You cannot add instance fields outside the record declaration, even if they are private
     8. Can override the implicit methods
     9. Records also do not support instance initializers. All initialization for the fields of a record must happen in a constructor.
